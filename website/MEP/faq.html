			<h1 class="display-5">What to Wear</h1>
			<hr class="my-4" size="7">
			<p class="text-justify jumbotron-text-pad"><strong>INDIVIDUALS:</strong> I recommend wearing something that
				suits your personal style - either neutral with layers and accessories, or more bold and colorful with a
				lot of texture to show off personality. This is an opportunity for you or your child to shine! For
				children, I usually recommend bare feet for indoors and nice boots or shoes that complement their outfit
				for outside (remember to use socks that match or no socks at all). I recommend clothing that has
				texture, such as knitting, embroidery, dark faded denim, buttons, and ruffles. This type of clothing
				tends to photograph well and adds a lot of visual interest. Most importantly, clothing should be
				comfortable and fit well!</p>
			<p class="text-justify jumbotron-text-pad"><strong>SIBLINGS:</strong> It can be difficult to coordinate
				colors and not look too matchy. I recommend picking a few colors, but try not to put them in the same
				exact clothing. The more layers, textures and colors, the better. Just pick colors that complement each
				other. I recommend bright or deep colors (jewel tones like mustard yellow, deep purple, turquoise, dark
				pink, etc.) and try to stay away from all white (use off-white or ivory instead) as well as neon colors.
				You may also want to avoid large labels/branding as they can be distracting.</p>
			<p class="text-justify  jumbotron-text-pad"><strong>FAMILIES:</strong> Choose a style you like and a few
				colors you like as well. Try to stay in the same neutral color family to even out bolder colors - such
				as grays/blacks or browns/tans. I recommend having the parents dress fashionable, yet simple and focus
				more of the funky, unique style on the kids. If you have 5 people all dressing with a lot of layers and
				accessories it can be too much. Dark jeans that have a grit to them is always a great choice for the
				parents or especially the husband. If you are going to wear a print, stay away from small prints, as
				there is not a lot of visual interest (think bold!). Continue to think about texture and color. You may
				think that certain colors don’t go together, but again think outside of the box and have fun!</p>
			<p class="text-justify  jumbotron-text-pad"><strong>ACCESSORIZE:</strong> Jewelry, hats, ties/bowties, etc.
				can add a lot of interest and final touches to an outfit!</p>
			<p class="text-justify  jumbotron-text-pad"><strong>WHERE TO SHOP:</strong> I do recommend investing in your
				clothing for the session since it does make a huge difference in the final product. Search out local
				boutiques, as they have one-of-a-kind style. There are countless boutique shops online these days as
				well. For budget-conscious choices, check local resale shops or online ones such as ThredUp.com. My
				personal favorite clothing brands are Zara, Boden/Mini Boden, Matilda Jane Clothing, H&M, and J.
				Crew/Crewcuts.</p>

			<h1 class="display-5">What to Bring</h1>
			<hr class="my-4" size="7">
			<p class="text-justify jumbotron-text-pad">Please bring clothing and accessories as needed. You can always
				arrive early and get your children dressed at the session if you are worried about them getting messy on
				the way. Please also bring chap-stick or lip gloss for children if needed (helps with chapped lips, as
				they are very hard to Photoshop). To be extra prepared, bring snacks (non-staining) & a favorite toy to
				comfort them if they are feeling overwhelmed at the session. Wet wipes always come in handy as well,
				especially for cleaning mouths & noses! Please clean your child’s face prior to pictures to make sure
				snack crumbs, boogies, etc., are all gone.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="jumbotron-fluid">
			<h1 class="display-5">What to Expect</h1>
			<hr class="my-4" size="7">
			<p class="text-justify jumbotron-text-pad">Children can be unpredictable, so it is
				my job to be ready for anything! Sometimes parents get frustrated because sessions don’t seem to be
				going perfectly... but the wonderful thing is that those small moments in between all the tantrums &
				chaos are beautiful. People often ask me how I even managed to get one great photograph of their wild
				child! The answer is simple... I shoot like crazy and it’s my job to capture it all. So... the only job
				I give you as the parents is to relax & enjoy it. I will do all the hard work! I will give a lot of
				direction during the session so you will know exactly what to do. Children match your energy, so if you
				are having fun & showing them how much you love them they will show you the same in return. Sounds
				simple, right? Even still, once in a while there are children that for whatever reason do not want to be
				photographed, so often I will ask to photograph a child or children away from parents so they will just
				focus on me and my lame jokes. It usually works! They don’t know me & most often children are on their
				best behavior for others. This can all be very important in making your session run smoothly.</p>
