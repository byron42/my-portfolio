      <description>For now, I&amp;rsquo;ve taken the React tutorial and added a method to highlight the winning column, and enhanced the interface for better look and feel.
I&amp;rsquo;m currently enrolled in a React.js course and intend to reiterate what I&amp;rsquo;ve learned from it here by ultimately componentizing this application.</description>

      <description>React application which allows a user to input expenses and then has an interface for viewing and tracking the expenses from year to year.
This is my first project from a React.js course which offers a very thorough deep dive into React components. It requires peer reviews, has various quizzes and checkpoints, and in my opinion is teaching React in a way that challenges how I think and what I understand about javascript.</description>
