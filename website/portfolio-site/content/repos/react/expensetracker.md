React application which allows a user to input expenses and then has an interface for viewing and tracking the expenses from year to year.  

This is my first project from a [React.js course](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/) which offers a very thorough deep dive into React components.  It requires peer reviews, has various quizzes and checkpoints, and in my opinion is teaching React in a way that challenges how I think and what I understand about javascript.  

As a disclaimer, all coding in this project was entered manually to become more acquainted with React and jsx.
