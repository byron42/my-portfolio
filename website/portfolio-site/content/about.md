##### **Where I am**
I'm an aspiring entry level software developer looking for a place to start a career. I know that what I've learned so far will benefit any employer that decides to give me an opportunity. Not only am I looking forward to it, I honestly canâ€™t wait to prove it.

<!-- ##### **What I need**
A chance to be molded into what someone is looking for.  I've learned all of these things, I want to put them to use for a purpose.  Otherwise, this seems to end up in an ever-expanding reality of becoming a jack-of-all-trades, which isn't exactly what I'm seeking.  I'm aware that there's value in knowing much about many things, but I really want to hone in my skills at this point. -->

##### **What I'm looking for**
I truly hope to find a place where I can anchor what I've learned from my education, and what I've accomplished in my free time.  Ideally, I would like to be around people who like to challenge themselves, and are willing to challenge others. In my experience, this is the best environment for creating new ideas, and improving upon others.
