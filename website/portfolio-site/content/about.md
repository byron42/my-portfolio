##### **Where I am**
I'm an aspiring application developer who is looking for a place to start a career.  I know that what I've learned so far will benefit any employer who decides to take me under thier wing.  Not only am I looking forward to it, I honestly can't wait to prove it.

##### **What I need**
A chance to be molded into what someone is looking for.  I've learned all of these things, I want to put them to use for a purpose.  Otherwise, this seems to end up in an ever-expanding reality of becoming a jack-of-all-trades, which isn't exactly what I'm seeking.  I'm aware that there's value in knowing much about many things, but I really want to hone in my skills at this point.

##### **What I'm looking for**
I truly hope to find a place where I can anchor what I've learned from my classes, and what I've accomplished in my free time.  Ideally, I would like to be around people who like to challenge themselves, and are willing to challenge others. As far as I can tell, there's no better environment for creating new ideas, or improving upon others...
