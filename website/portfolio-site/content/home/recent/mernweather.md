**MERN** application that grabs an openweather API and stores the JSON in MongoDB.  There is also a function that stores a timestamp for each submit in local storage that can be cleared from within the app.  

As of right now only US zips are readable because of the API, but I would like to rework this in the future so that it accesses the geolocation API (enter city name). For now this is functional and running error free.
